if you are ready to commit your changes, you would tell git.
--  " git commit -am hello.hs " 

now you still have to push the changes to the remote origin.
-- " git push "

--github

you looking to "clone the repo" ?

click that github Code button to get the link
then in nix/terminal try: git clone [LINK]
git clone git@github.com:input-output-hk/plutus-pioneer-program.git

creates a new dir, Cloning into 'plutus-pioneer-program'
ls plutus-pioneer-program
cd plutus-pioneer-program - change dir into the plutus code dir
ls - list files
add "learn git basics" and "learn command-line basics, zsh" to your learning list! lol
there's a lot of experience you'll gain just by doing it every day

I keep all my git stuff in a directory called Code
so like /Users/gary/code
then in that dir I do all my cloning from github or elsewhere
git clone {repo-url}

I always go with SSH
where you see Https SSH and Github cli
i copy that link, and type: git clone {link}
in my code dir
it downloads it all into a new dir it will create

Image
now I have all of it in my code/learnhaskell dir
i added my ssh key to github so that I didn't have to enter credentials each time
the github cli might be easier too, i don't know
