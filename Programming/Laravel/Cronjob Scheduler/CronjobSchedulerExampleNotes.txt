a cronjob is just a job that runs on a schedule. usually every X minutes, etc.

pre req. a)tinkerwell b)laravel

1) open tinkerwell

2)

$api = 'https://server.jpgstoreapis.com/policy/a51b52822dc9fec24c00a110d3ef509b799b06436872714ca4d4a942/listings?page=1';

Http::get($api)->json()a;



paste that and press CMD + R to run it

(so what you just did was use the jpg.store api to fetch the recent 100 supervirus listings)
(if you change the word "listings" to "sales" you will fetch the sales instead)

ok let's do something else, i only want to see supervirus listings where the price is 12 ada or less (inside tinkerwell)

$json = Http::get($api)->json();
collect($json)
    ->filter(function($item){
        return $item['price_lovelace'] < 12 * 1000000;
    });

these are all laravel helpers and methods
http::get() = super easy to fetch remote apis with the http client
collect() = excellent way of handling arrays/objects without writing a bunch of similar code

the mechanism that alerts me is an mac command

$phrase = 'Testing';
$title = 'Notice!';
$cmd = sprintf('osascript -e \'display notification "%s" with title "%s"\'', $phrase, $title);
shell_exec($cmd);

you can CMD T to open a new tab in Tinkerwell
paste those lines and run it

optional* pushover.net

----------------------------------------------------------

$api = 'https://pool.pm/wallet/addr1q96pl4zda0hkn550y68muhhar096l2awuf0ey0lxze8w3g4phwzrdqmmk6335x5t48f3vj6ask4a36hj5cc0vs93epfs22mkhj';
$json = Http::get($api)->json();

that uses pool.pm to fetch a wallet address, and display its data
